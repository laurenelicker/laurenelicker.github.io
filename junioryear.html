								The experience that impacted me the most this past school year was having in-person classes. Fall 2021 was the first time 
                I had an in-person class since changing my major to physics/astrophysics (I changed majors after Spring 2020 semester). 
                This was the first time I was able to meet my physics peers in person; I finally felt like I was able to form a community 
                in my new major. In addition to the social benefits that came from in-person classes, I also found there to be academic 
                benefits. While the material in my classes became more challenging this past year, I felt like I understood the concepts 
                better this than when my classes were online. After the Spring 2021 semester, I was feeling a little discouraged about my 
                studies; however, after having in-person classes again, I feel more confident in my abilities to learn and communicate 
                physics concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                Two other experiences that greatly impacted me (and my future) this past year were doing undergraduate research and being 
                a physics Teaching Assistant (TA). Getting undergraduate research experience was extremely important to me because I wanted 
                to learn what doing research is like and prepare for graduate school. I started working with Dr. Bayliss in Summer 2021 
                and he has given me many opportunities to not only work on research but give presentations about my work, both of which 
                are invaluable and will make me a competitive graduate school applicant. Dr. Bayliss encouraged me to submit an abstract/poster 
                to the 2022 University of Cincinnati Undergraduate Scholarly Research Showcase and to the American Astronomical Society 
                meetings in January and June. Getting experience as a TA was also important to me because it made me realize that I enjoy 
                helping others work on physics problems and that I might like to become a professor one day. Getting research and TA 
                experience has further solidified my plans to go to graduate school and aspire to become an astrophysics professor.
                </p>
                <p>
                This summer, I will be working on research at the Cosmic Dawn Center in Copenhagen. I am extremely excited for this 
                experience, and I foresee it being valuable because I will meet new undergraduate/graduate physics students and physics 
                professors/researchers. I will be exposed to new research being done which will help me narrow down which field of 
                astrophysics I want to pursue in graduate school.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the next year, my main goal will be completing graduate school applications. I hope to create a list of graduate programs 
                I am interested in over this summer so that I can organize their application requirements before I am busy during the Fall 
                2022 semester. I also want to continue working on my research with Dr. Bayliss, potentially writing a paper on it by the end 
                of the school year.
