								The experience that impacted me the most this year was struggling with my academics for the first time. This was my first 
                year as a physics major, and I did not expect my physics classes to be as difficult as they were. Prior to this year, I 
                had never struggled understanding topics in my classes; if something had been confusing, I could typically figure it out 
                after spending some time thinking about it. But my physics courses were completely shocking. I would stare at my homework 
                problems and not even know where to start. I felt like maybe because I started as an engineering major, I wasn’t taught the 
                same things in my first-year physics courses that the physics majors were. I used the learning commons for a tutoring session, 
                and I found out that these courses are considered the “weed-out” classes for physics majors and that everyone struggles with 
                them. This helped me feel less alone with my struggles, but I still felt distant from the physics student community because 
                our classes were remote due to COVID. I’m looking forward to meeting my fellow physics peers in the fall (as long as classes 
                are still scheduled to be in person). Overall, I finished my physics classes with decent grades, so I definitely do not consider 
                this experience to be a failure; I just learned what hard work actually looks like, and I had to change my expectations for 
                future physics classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                Another experience that impacted me very much this year was my search for a summer research experience. As a physics major who 
                plans on going to graduate school and becoming a researcher or professor, I knew that having undergraduate research experience 
                was vital for my goals. I want to learn what being a researcher is like so that I can better evaluate whether or not my future 
                goals are best for me. In January, I found out about REU opportunities (Research Experience for Undergraduates). Over the next 
                couple months, I applied to 17 REUs. I thought that applying to 17 REUs would guarantee that I get accepted to one, but I did 
                not realize how competitive these programs are. I was either rejected or ghosted from every single one I applied to (with the 
                exception of first getting waitlisted at one REU but ultimately getting rejected). This was honestly a very disheartening 
                experience for me. I spent hours on each application and getting rejections just made me feel like I wasn’t good enough to do 
                research. I was encouraged by my family and a graduate lab TA to talk to professors about doing summer research with them. I 
                was intimidated to talk to professors who I had never meet before about doing research with them, but I am very glad that I 
                did because one professor offered me a paid summer research position where I get to study galaxy clusters and present my research 
                at future academic conferences. I’m definitely nervous to start this research position but I am very excited to learn more about 
                physics and research. Overall, this experience of applying for summer research positions and getting rejected taught me how 
                determined I can be and how to not give up just from a couple rejections. I learned that I really wanted to do research this 
                summer and that I needed to keep trying and use all of my resources until I was given an opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                As far as future goals, I hope to use my experience struggling in my classes to reach out to professors early in the semester 
                and utilize their office hours to help me understand topics whenever I am feeling lost. I also hope to continue my summer research 
                in the fall semester and continue improving my research skills and learning more about physics.
