		I spent my gap year living in New Mexico and working on research at Los Alamos National Laboratory! This experience
                was a billion times better than I thought it could be. While moving two time zones away from my friends and family was
                tough, the confidence I have gained in myself as a researcher and the relationships I have formed out in Los Alamos
                made it all worthwhile.
                </p>
                <p>
                Los Alamos is a quirky place: businesses and (the roughly five) restaurants are closed early and often, everyone's hobby is 
                running and hiking, and most residents are scientists (smart, opinionated, confident) who work at the lab. The town is at an 
                elevation of ~7500 ft, and it took me months of poor sleep to adjust. I've always been a slow runner, but the thin oxygen up 
                there made my mile time even slower.
                </p>
                <p>
                Working at LANL was quirky as well. There were lots of security procedures that I had to follow, and intense organizational 
                structure and policies. But I had fun! l learned about a new area of astrophysics (black hole x-ray binaries), and I had a lot 
                of freedom with how I'd spend my time and what parts of my research I wanted to focus on. My mentor was amazing, which definitely 
                made my experience at the lab better than other post-baccalaureates I met. I also established a great routine; I'd get to work 
                early (7AM), workout after, and then relax or do chore-type things. Aside from being 50 minutes away from a Target, I felt pretty happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the Fall, I spent much of my free time applying to graduate school, which was very stressful. After the Winter holidays, I felt like 
                I had extra free time, so I got a part time job at the Los Alamos Arts Council! I love art, so this was a nice way to bring that back 
                into my life and meet people in Los Alamos outside of the lab. In the Spring, I traveled a ton, visiting graduate programs I had been 
                accepted to. And the school I will be attending is ... (drumroll) ... the University of Pittsburgh!
                </p>
                <p>
                Living out west for the first time, I definitely wanted to take advantage of the natural landscape and do some cool hiking! I visited 
                Valles Caldera National Preserve a couple times in the Fall and Winter. In December, I traveled to White Sands and Carlsbad Caverns national 
                parks. In April, I explored Bandelier National Monument with my parents. I took a roadtrip in May to Petrified Forest, Grand Canyon, Zion, 
                Bryce Canyon, Arches, and Black Canyon of the Gunnison national parks. For Memorial Day weekend, I went on a hiking trip to Chaco Canyon 
                National Historical Park with a co-worker; we stayed in a remote cabin (a little creepy) and got great views of the stars because of the 
                lack of light pollution.â€‹
                </p>
                <p>
                I loved the research I did at LANL and the people I worked with. I wish that I could've completely finished my project before leaving, 
		but I'm glad that I still have an opportunity to continue working on this research (remotely), and I know that the door is always open 
		for me to return to LANL. I cannot stress how much the people I met in Los Alamos mean to me. What started as a disappointing "forced" 
		gap year turned into one of the most impactful experirences I could have had. I was extremely sad to leave Los Alamos, but I'm also excited 
		to start the next chapter of my life: graduate school!
