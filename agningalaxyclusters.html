									This project uses Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and WISE catalog images
									to identify brightest cluster galaxies that are "active" (active galactic nuclei; AKA supermassive
									black holes) in the centers of strong lensing galaxy clusters. I'm starting with a lot of astro
									lingo, so I'll explain each piece below.
								</p>

									Galaxy clusters are composed of 100s to 1000s of gravitationally bound galaxies. These are the most 
									massive structures in the universe. Galaxy clusters have extremely strong gravitational fields, 
									causing some of them to be strong lensing. Strong lensing is the bending of light because of the 
									presence of a strong gravitational field (and the consequent bending of spacetime). It's the same 
									principle as light bending (refraction) when it travels through different materials (air, water, etc.).
								</p>
								<img src="images/refraction_fish.jpg" style="width:360px; height:420px; object-fit: cover;">
								<p style="font-size:16px; ">
									In the image above, we see two images of the same fish and the same mug in a fish tank because of 
									light bending. The same effect happens with obejcts in space. When a background object is strongly 
									lensed by a galaxy cluster, the background object can get distorted and appear as multiple images. 
									Extended streaks of light are classic signs of strong lensing (called Einstein rings), which can be 
									seen in our sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters below.
								</p>
								<img src="images/sgas_rogues_large.png" style="width:700px; height:700px; object-fit: cover;">
								<p style="font-size:16px; ">
									The cause of a cluster being strong lensing or non-lensing is not well known. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In the centers of most galaxy clusters is a highly luminious and massive galaxy, called the brightest 
									cluster galaxy (BCG). There can be multiple BCGs, if, for example, two galaxy clusters merged together, 
									but generally each galaxy cluster has one BCG. They can be identified in the cluster gallery two figures 
									above as a bright, large, circlular object in the center of an Einstein ring.
								</p>
								<p style="font-size:16px; ">
									Thinking more broadly, a BCG is a massive galaxy, and at the center of most large galaxies is a 
									supermassive black hole. Black holes are either dormant, meaning they are not 'feeding' on any matter, 
									or active, meaning that they are consuming gas and emitting lots of energy. These active black holes 
									are called active galactic nuclei (AGN).
