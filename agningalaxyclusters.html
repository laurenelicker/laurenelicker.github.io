									This project uses Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and WISE catalog images
									to identify brightest cluster galaxies that are "active" (active galactic nuclei; AKA supermassive
									black holes) in the centers of strong lensing galaxy clusters. I'm starting with a lot of astro
									lingo, so I'll explain each piece below.

									Galaxy clusters are composed of 100s to 1000s of gravitationally bound galaxies. These are the most 
									massive structures in the universe. Galaxy clusters have extremely strong gravitational fields, 
									causing some of them to be strong lensing. Strong lensing is the bending of light because of the 
									presence of a strong gravitational field (and the consequent bending of spacetime). It's the same 
									principle as light bending (refraction) when it travels through different materials (air, water, etc.).

									In the image above, we see two images of the same fish and the same mug in a fish tank because of 
									light bending. The same effect happens with obejcts in space. When a background object is strongly 
									lensed by a galaxy cluster, the background object can get distorted and appear as multiple images. 
									Extended streaks of light are classic signs of strong lensing (called Einstein rings), which can be 
									seen in our sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters below.

									The cause of a cluster being strong lensing or non-lensing is not well known. The plot below displays 
									the strong lensing cross section (probability of a cluster being strong lensing) against mass, and the 
									data points at constant mass vary 2-3 orders of magnitude in strong lensing cross section. This suggests 
									that mass is not a direct indicator of strong lensing likelihood and there must be other physcial 
									properties that cause strong lensing. Is there something about the galaxy population of clusters that 
									contribute to their strong lensing likelihood?

									In the centers of most galaxy clusters is a highly luminious and massive galaxy, called the brightest 
									cluster galaxy (BCG). There can be multiple BCGs, if, for example, two galaxy clusters merged together, 
									but generally each galaxy cluster has one BCG. They can be identified in the cluster gallery two figures 
									above as a bright, large, circlular object in the center of an Einstein ring.
								</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px; ">
									Thinking more broadly, a BCG is a massive galaxy, and at the center of most large galaxies is a 
									supermassive black hole. Black holes are either dormant, meaning they are not 'feeding' on any matter, 
									or active, meaning that they are consuming gas and emitting lots of energy. These active black holes 
									are called active galactic nuclei (AGN). AGN form in galaxies when cool gas falls deep into the central 
									gravitational potential well of a galaxy - right where a black hole resides. The frequency of AGN in the 
									central BCGs of galaxy clusters could tell us about the gas environment in clusters. Higher AGN frequency 
									in BCG would increase the mass density of galaxy clusters (more cool gas in the center of the galaxy cluster) 
									which may increase the strong lensing cross section of those galaxy clusters.
								</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px; ">
									For this project, we aim to identify AGN in BCG in a strong lensing selected sample of galaxy clusters 
									and compare our strong lensing AGN-hosting BCG fraction to that of a general mass selected sample of galaxy 
									clusters. If our fraction is higher, that may suggest that the presence of AGN increases the mass density of 
									galaxy clusters enough to increase their strong lensing cross section. AGN are extremely energic objects. Gas 
									being pulled into a black hole via an accretion disk is hot and travels fast, so AGN efficiently convert potential 
									energy into high energy radiation. Therefore, we can observe X-ray radiation (which is high energy) from AGN. 
									We use Chandra X-ray Observatory images of 31 strong lensing galaxy clusters to ultimately identify X-ray AGN 
									in the cluster fields.
