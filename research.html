									Welcome to my research pages! I've worked on a variety of astrophysics 
									topics during my undergrad at the University of Cincinnati, as part of 
									an REU at the Cosmic Dawn Center in Copenhagen, while a post-baccalaureate 
									researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and as a current grad student at 
									the University of Pittsburgh. My research interests have covered black 
									holes/AGN, galaxy evolution, and galaxy clusters. For more details, check 
									out the pages for each research topic below (actively under construction)!

									You can read my Astrobites articles to learn more about my research, too! One details
