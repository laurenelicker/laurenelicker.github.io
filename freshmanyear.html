								The experience that has had the most impact on my academic and professional future this year was deciding to switch my major. 
                Starting college, I thought there was no way that I was going to change my major; I had been telling people that I was 
                going to become an aerospace engineer since middle school. However, when sitting in my Intro to Aerospace Engineering class 
                this spring, I quickly realized that it was not the right path for me. I realized that I was completely fascinated with space 
                and how the universe works, but not as interested in the machines that get humans into space. So I decided to switch my major 
                to astrophysics, which completely changed how my college experience and timeline will be.
                </p>
                <p>
                Instead of taking five years to get my degree and having to spend five semesters doing co-ops, my college path is more 
                straight-forward, only taking four years to get my degree with no required co-ops. However, I believe that getting real-life 
                experience is still very important. So now one of my goals is to get involved in a physics research project as an undergraduate 
                student. Additionally, as an engineering major, I was not sure if I wanted to go to graduate school. However, as an astrophysics 
                major, I now plan on going graduate school, most likely to get my PhD (which going to school for another 6 or so years is crazy 
                but exciting). I am hoping that doing a research experience before I graduation will help me figure out if I want to go to 
                graduate school to continue doing research.
                </p>
                <p>
                Another experience that potentially changed my professional goals is helping my peers study for their math and physics classes. 
                I felt like I was good at explaining concepts to my friends and I enjoyed helping them learn information. I found that I might 
                be interested in becoming a physics teacher or professor. To further determine whether or not I will enjoy teaching, I plan on 
                volunteering through the Bearcat Buddies program this year. Through this program, I would tutor students at Cincinnati schools. 
                Additionally, I want to look into becoming an SI leader or recitation instructor in the next couple of years.
                </p>
                <p>
                Overall, my first year was very different than I expected (in addition to there being a pandemic). I never thought I would change 
                my major but I am super excited for the future and I am ready to dive deep into the world of physics.
